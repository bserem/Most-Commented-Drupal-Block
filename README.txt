The code here is an exported view for Drupal Views-2.

The view along with the acompanying css (which you have to add to your theme in any way you prefer)
will result in a block showing the 5 most popular articles.
The block will be style like engadgets block for most popular articles.
Keep in mind that the bargraph is not dynamic, it is static (just like engadgets).

I will probably add some more tweaks to this block in the future
(pseudo-dynamic bars so as for the design to change as days go by and more)
